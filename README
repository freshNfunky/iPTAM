NOTE: This project is out of date and is not being maintained. 

Usage:
The project can be downloaded as is and compiled in XCode. You will need a provisioned iPhone running iOS >4.0 to compile the software.The project should compile out of the box. 

Please be aware that this is not  intended to be a complete project in ANY sense and needs a huge amount of work in order to further its utility as an Augmented Reality application pose estimator. Please read Report.pdf for more details on the port I have attempted.
